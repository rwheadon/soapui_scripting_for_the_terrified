			SoapUI can provide responses that are somewhat dynamic and varying with the use of scripting. An initial benefit is that you will not necessarily need to constantly edit responses if your request data changes. This document will go through the basic process of scripting responses.
			</p>
			<p>
			The first practice you should adopt is the renaming of all responses that you generate.The term response1 and response2 will become difficult to visually track and will cause ambiguity to those reading any logic you script. The author uses a convention similar to operation-name_response_intent for naming responses. Following the author's convention a request that will return a blank response for customer search might have a name like: searchCustomer_response_blank. Following this convention will also make the ctrl+W command (open windows) much easier to read. The images below illustrate one benefit to some sort of intuitive naming convention.

				This tutorial will use a trivial model to present the scripting topics. A grooming kit request will be made that includes some very basic pet information that will be used to return a response containing a kit code and price to be used when charging the customer for services and supplies. This simple scripting example will show how to pass-through certain values and also how to apply decision logic on other values.
			</p>
			<p>
				As with most SoapUI projects ours will begin with a wsdl. Follow the instructions in Appendix A to create and save the project wsdl, then create a new generic project in SoapUI using that wsdl as a base. SoapUI should automatically generate your first request and response. This is a good time to rename "request1" and "response1" to something more meaningful.
